			The Biden-Netanyahu relationship is strained like never before. Can the two leaders move forward?.

              <div class="post-content"><p> WASHINGTON—President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have long managed a complicated relationship, but they’re running out of space to maneuver as their views on the Gaza war diverge and their political futures hang in the balance.

Their ties have hit a low point as Biden holds up the delivery of heavy bombs to Israel—and warns that the provision of artillery and other weaponry also could be suspended if Netanyahu moves forward with a widescale operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.

Netanyahu, for his part, is brushing off Biden’s warnings and vowing to press ahead, saying, “If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone.”</p>

<p>“If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails. But we have much more than fingernails,” he said.</p>

<p>Biden has long prided himself on being able to manage Netanyahu more with carrots than sticks. But the escalation of
 friction over the past seven months suggests that his approach may be long past its best-by date.

With both men balancing an explosive Mideast situation against their own domestic political problems, Netanyahu has grown 
increasingly resistant to Biden’s public charm offensives and private pleading, prompting the president’s more assertive pushback in the past several weeks.

“If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails. But we have much more than fingernails,” he said.</p>

<p>Biden has long prided himself on being able to manage Netanyahu more with carrots than sticks. But the escalation of friction over
 the past seven months suggests that his approach may be long past its best-by date.</p>

<p>With both men balancing an explosive Mideast situation against their own domestic political problems, Netanyahu has grown
 increasingly resistant to Biden’s public charm offensives and private pleading, prompting the president’s more assertive pushback in the past several weeks.
 “If they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem,”
 Biden said in a CNN interview Wednesday, laying bare his growing differences with Netanyahu.</P>

<p>Biden aides nonetheless insist the president is unwilling to allow the US-Israel relationship to truly rupture on his watch. They cite not only the political im
perative—a majority of Americans support Israel—but also Biden’s personal history with the country and his belief in its right to defend itself.
The president’s aides, watching how pro-Palestinian protests have roiled his party and the college campuses that have been breeding grounds for 
Democratic voters, have mused for months that Biden could be the last classically pro-Israel Democrat in the White House.</p>

<p>Their optimism about their ability to contain Netanyahu may be falling into the same trap that has vexed a long line of American presidents who have clashed with the Israeli leader over the decades.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby on Thursday declined to say whether Biden informed Netanyahu of his decision to suspend shipment of 3,500 bombs when the leaders spoke earlier this week. But he said Biden has been “direct and forthright” with Netanyahu about his concerns.

Biden and Netanyahu have known each other since Biden was a young senator and Netanyahu was a senior official in Israel’s embassy in Washington.</p>
